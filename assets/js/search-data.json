F3D (pronounced `/fɛd/`) is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer. It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support lot of rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing. It is fully controllable from the command line and support configuration files. It can provide thumbnails, support interactive hotkeys, drag&drop and integration into file managers. F3D also contains the libf3d, a simple library to render meshes, with C++, Python and Java Bindings. *A typical render by F3D* *Animation of a glTF file within F3D* *A direct scalars render by F3D* See the [gallery](/doc/GALLERY.html) for more images, take a look at the [changelog](/doc/CHANGELOG.html) or go to the [releases page](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/releases) to download F3D!

We suggest using VTK 9.2.2 with RenderingRayTracing, RenderingExternal and IOExodus modules enabled in order to get as many features as possible in F3D. ## Configuration and building Configure and generate the project with CMake, then build the software using your build system. Here is some CMake options of interest:: * `F3D_BUILD_APPLICATION`: Build the F3D executable. * `F3D_INSTALL_SDK`: Install the F3D SDK for the [libf3d](/doc/libf3d/README_LIBF3D.html). * `BUILD_TESTING`: Enable the [tests](/doc/dev/TESTING.html). * `F3D_MACOS_BUNDLE`: On macOS, build a `.app` bundle. * `F3D_WINDOWS_GUI`: On Windows, build a Win32 application (without console). * `F3D_WINDOWS_BUILD_SHELL_THUMBNAILS_EXTENSION`: On Windows, build the shell thumbnails extension. * `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD`: Build all plugins as static library (embedded into `libf3d`) and automatically loaded by the application. Some modules, plugins and bindings depending on external libraries can be optionally enabled with the following CMake variables: * `F3D_MODULE_RAYTRACING`: Support for raytracing rendering. Requires that VTK has been built with `OSPRay` and `VTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingRayTracing` turned on. Disabled by default. * `F3D_MODULE_EXTERNAL_RENDERING`: Support for external render window, Requires that VTK has been built with `VTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingExternal` turned on. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_EXODUS`: Support for ExodusII (.ex2) file format. Requires that VTK has been built with `IOExodus` module (and `hdf5`). Enabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_OCCT`: Support for STEP and IGES file formats. Requires `OpenCASCADE`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ASSIMP`: Support for FBX, DAE, OFF and DXF file formats. Requires `Assimp`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ALEMBIC`: Support for ABC file format. Requires `Alembic`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_DRACO`: Support for DRC file format. Requires `Draco`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_BINDINGS_PYTHON`: Generate python bindings (requires `Python` and `pybind11`). Disabled by default. * `F3D_BINDINGS_JAVA`: Generate java bindings (requires `Java` and `JNI`). Disabled by default. ## Installing Installation can be done through CMake, by running the following command: ``` cmake --install ${your_build_dir} ``` Optional components can be installed by specifying the component name: ``` cmake --install ${your_build_dir} --component ${component_name} ``` Here is the list of the optional components you can install: * `mimetypes`: Install plugins mimetype XML files for integration with Freedesktop (Linux only) ",

    "content": "# How to contribute F3D welcomes all contributors, regardless of skill level or experience! ## How to get started To contribute to F3D, you may want to take a look at the opened [issues](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues), especially, the ones with the [\"good first issue\"](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. If one sounds interesting to you, then you should just go ahead and comment on the issue and ask for any help or clarification needed. F3D maintainers will see your comment and provide guidance as needed. You can also open your own issue or feature request and F3D maintainers will try to help you with it! You can then fix the issue in your side and contribute it to the F3D repository, by following the workflow described below. ## F3D Development workflow F3D uses the [gitlab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html). In a few words, here is how to contribute: - [Fork](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/fork) F3D repository on github. - Create and push a feature branch on your fork containing new commits. - When it is ready for review or when you want to run the CI, create a pull request against `f3d-app/f3d/master`. - Once the PR is approved and CI comes back clean, a F3D maintainer will merge your pull request in the master branch - The master now contains your changes and will be present in the next release! ## Continuous Integration F3D has a pretty extensive continuous integration trying to cover all usecases for F3D. It means that if your change break the CI in your PR, it will not be merged until the breaking change are addressed. It also means that adding a new feature or behavior means adding a associated test. Make sure to check the results for yourself, and ask for help if needed. F3D continuous integration will also check the coverage as it is a good way to evaluate if new features are being tested or not. When adding code to F3D, always to to cover it by adding/modifying [tests](/doc/dev/TESTING.html). F3D continuous integration also check formatting using clang-format and will inform you if changes needs to be made. However, some [formatting rules](/doc/dev/CODING_STYLE.html) are not enforced by clang-format and will be checked during the review process. ## F3D architecture F3D is separated in three main components: - The F3D application, in the application folder. - The libf3d, in the library folder. - The VTKExtensions in the library/VTKExtensions folder. VTKExtensions are separated in different modules. - Core, that do not depend on any other VTKExtensions modules are provide services for all modules - Readers, that depends on Core and implements many new VTK readers and importers - Rendering, that depends on Core and implements the rendering specificities of F3D - Applicative, the depends on all other VTKExtension modules and provide services for the libf3d library The libf3d implements the whole logic of instancing and manipulating the different VTK classes, it is fully documented [here](../libf3d/README.md). The F3D application itself uses the libf3d but adds an applicative layer on top of it, especially the handling of [command line options](../OPTIONS.md) and [configuration file](../CONFIGURATION_FILE.md).

These tests are simple C++ methods that should return `EXIT_SUCESS` or `EXIT_FAILURE`. Everything is handled in `src/library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing`. To add a test, first identify which VTKExtensions module you need to add a test into, then create a new `TestName.cxx` file containing a `int TestName(int argc, char* argv[])` method, then implement your test in C++ using VTK and F3D VTKExtensions modules. Then add you new file to `src/library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing/CMakeLists.txt`. It is supported to read file as input if needed, see other tests as examples. ",

    "content": "# Classes Introduction This is only an introduction to libf3d classes. For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Engine class The engine class is the main class that needs to be instantiated. All other classes instance are provided by the engine using getters, `getLoader`, `getWindow`, `getInteractor`, `getOptions`. The engine constructor lets you choose the type of window in its constructor, `NONE`, `NATIVE`, `NATIVE_OFFSCREEN`, `EXTERNAL`. Default is `NATIVE`. See [Window class](window-class) documentation for more info. Please note that the engine will not provide a interactor with `NONE` and `EXTERNAL`. A static function `loadPlugin` can also be called to load reader plugins. It must be called before loading any file. An internal plugin containing VTK native readers can be loaded by calling `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"native\");`. Other plugins maintained by F3D team are available if their build is enabled: `alembic`, `assimp`, `draco`, `exodus` and `occt`. If CMake option `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD` is enabled, the plugins listed above are also static just like `native` plugin. All static plugins can be loaded using `f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins()`. ## Loader class The loader class is responsible to read and load the file from the disk. It supports reading multiple files and even folders. ## Window class The window class is responsible for rendering the meshes. It supports multiple modes. * `NONE`: A window that will not render anything, very practical when only trying to recover meta-information about the data. * `NATIVE`: Default mode where a window is shown onscreen using native graphical capabilities. * `NATIVE_OFFSCREEN`: Use native graphical capabilities for rendering, but unto an offscreen window, which will not appear on screen, practical when generating screenshots. * `EXTERNAL`: A window where the OpenGL context is not created but assumed to have been created externally. To be used with other frameworks like Qt or GLFW. Window lets you `render`, `renderToImage` and control other parameters of the window, like icon or windowName. ## Interactor class When provided by the engine, the interactor class lets you choose how to interact with the data. It contains the animation API to start and stop animation. Interactor also lets you set your interaction callbacks in order to modify how the interaction with the data is done. Of course, you can use `start` and `stop` to control the interactor behavior. ## Camera class Provided by the window, this class lets you control the camera. You can either specify the camera position, target, and up direction directly, or specify movements relative to the current camera state. ## Image class A generic image class that can either be created from a window, from an image filepath or even from a data buffer. It supports comparison making it very practical in testing context. ## Log class A class to control logging in the libf3d. Simple using the different dedicated methods (`print`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and `setVerboseLevel`, you can easily control what to display. Please note that, on windows, a dedicated output window may be created. ## Options class This class lets you control the behavior of the libf3d. An option is basically a string used as a key associated with a value, see the exhaustive [list](/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html). ## Reader class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly. ## Plugin class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly.

    "content": "# libf3d - A library to render 3D meshes By Michael Migliore and Mathieu Westphal. libf3d is a BSD-licensed C++ library to open and render 3D meshes. It is of course used by F3D. libf3d API is simple and easy to learn. Python bindings are provided through pybind11. Java bindings are also available. libf3d API is still in alpha version and may change drastically in the future. ## Getting Started Rendering a file and starting the interaction is very easy: ```cpp #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Add a file to the loader and load it eng.getLoader().addFile(\"path/to/file.ext\").loadFile(); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Manipulating the window directly can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(f3d::window::Type::NATIVE_OFFSCREEN); // Add a file to the loader and load it eng.getLoader().addFile(\"path/to/file.ext\").loadFile(); // Set the window size and render to an image f3d::image img = eng.getWindow().setSize(300, 300).renderToImage(); // Save the image to a file img.save(\"/path/to/img.png\"); ``` Changing some options can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Recover the options and set the wanted value eng.getOptions() .set(\"render.effect.ssao\", true) .set(\"render.effect.fxaa\", true); // Standard libf3d usage eng.getLoader().addFile(\"path/to/file.ext\").loadFile(); eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Most options are dynamic, some are only taken into account when loading a file. See the [options](/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html) documentation. Find more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples), you can also find other usages in the [testing directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/library/testing). For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Building against the libf3d Please follow instructions in the [F3D build guide](/doc/dev/BUILD.html), then use CMake to find the libf3d and link against it like this in your CMakeLists.txt: ```cmake find_package(f3d REQUIRED) [...] target_link_libraries(target f3d::libf3d) ``` ## Extending libf3d with plugins In order to add new supported file format to libf3d, you can create a plugin using CMake macros.

The first thing (and most difficult part) you have to do is creating a VTK reader (or a VTK importer if you want to support a full scene with materials, lights and cameras), and wrap it into a VTK module. You can create several readers in the same VTK module if you need to support several file formats in a single plugin. Then, declare the reader(s) and the plugin using the CMake macros: ```cmake f3d_plugin_init() f3d_plugin_declare_reader( NAME \"ReaderName\" EXTENSIONS ${reader_ext} # set the extensions the reader can support MIMETYPES ${reader_mime} # set the mimetypes the reader can support VTK_READER ${vtk_classname} # set the name of the VTK class you have created DESCRIPTION \"Reader description\" ) # More f3d_plugin_declare_reader calls are possible f3d_plugin_build( NAME \"PluginName\" VERSION 1.0 DESCRIPTION \"Plugin description\" VTK_MODULES CommonCore CommonExecutionModel # Add more VTK modules if necessary ) ``` If the build succeeds, a library called `libf3d-plugin-.so` will be created (`f3d-plugin-.dll` on Windows) ## Loading your plugin The plugin can be loaded using `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"path or name\")` api if you are using libf3d, or `--load-plugins=\"path or name\"` option if you are using F3D application.

    "content": "# Configuration File Almost all the command-line options can be controlled using a configuration file. This configuration file uses the \"long\" version of the options in a JSON formatted file to provide values for these options. These options can be organized by block using a regular expression for each block in order to provide different default values for the different filetypes. A special block, named `global`, will apply to all files. Using a command-line option will override the corresponding value in the config file. The `global` block and command-line options are only taken into account on the first load and not on subsequent loads, when switching between files. The regular expression blocks are always taken into account, even when loading further files. A typical config file may look like this: ```javascript { \"global\": { \"bg-color\": \"0.7,0.7,0.7\", \"color\": \"0.5,0.1,0.1\", \"fxaa\": true, \"timer\": true, \"progress\": true, \"axis\": true, \"bar\": true, \"roughness\": 0.2, \"grid\": true, \"scalars\": true }, \".*vt.\": { \"edges\": true }, \".*gl(tf|b)\": { \"raytracing\": true, \"denoise\": true, \"samples\": 3 }, \".*mhd\": { \"volume\": true } } ``` Here, the first block defines a basic global configuration with many desired options for all files. The second block specifies that all files ending with vt., eg: vtk, vtp, vtu, ... will be shown with edges visibility turned on. The third block specifies raytracing usage for .gltf and .glb files. The last block specifies that volume rendering should be used with .mhd files. F3D provides a default config file for generic usage (`config.json`) and a thumbnail specific config file (`thumbnail.json`). You can edit these files or copy then into specific locations (see below) in order to customize F3D behavior. The following command-line options cannot be set via config file: `help`, `version`, `readers-list`, `config`, `dry-run`. The following command-line options can only be set in the global block of the config file: `no-render`, `inputs`, `output`, `quiet`, `verbose`, `resolution`, `position` and all testing options. Boolean options that have been turned on in the configuration file can be turned off on the command line if needed, eg: `--point-sprites=false`. The configuration file possible locations depends on your operating system. They are considered in the below order and only the first found will be used. * Linux: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/f3d/config.json`, `~/.config/f3d/config.json`, `/etc/f3d/config.json`, `/usr/share/f3d/config.json`, `[install_dir]/share/f3d/config.json` * Windows: `%APPDATA%\\f3d\\config.json`, `[install_dir]\\config.json` * macOS: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/f3d/config.json`, `~/.config/f3d/config.json`, `/usr/local/etc/f3d/config.json`, `f3d.app/Contents/Resources/config.json` The binary release will install the config files. On Linux, they will be installed in `[install_dir]/share/f3d/`, on Windows, it will be installed in the install directory, on macOS, it will be installed in the bundle. Please note there is a command line option to control the configuration file to read. Using it, one can specify an absolute/relative path for the configuration path, but also only the filename or filestem (`.json` will be added) to look for in the locations listed above, instead of looking for `config.json`, eg: `f3d --config=custom_config` will look for `custom_config.json` in locations listed above.

Many file managers use this mechanism, including nautilus, thunar, pcmanfm and caja. The simplest way to obtain desktop integration on linux is to use a package for your distribution, or the .deb binary release package we provide if compatible with your distribution. In other cases, the binary release archive can be used like this: 0. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is part of your `PATH` 1. Extract F3D binary release archive in `~/.local/` 2. Update your [mime database](https://linux.die.net/man/1/update-mime-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/mime` 3. Update your [desktop database](https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/update-desktop-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/application` ```bash export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin tar -xzvf f3d-1.3.0-Linux.tar.gz -C ~/.local/ sudo update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/ sudo update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications ``` If you have any issues, refer to the [troubleshooting](/doc/user/LIMITATIONS_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING.html) part. ## Windows For Windows desktop integration, F3D rely on a registered shell extension. Using the F3D NSIS installer (.exe) is the simplest way to enable thumbnails and integrate F3D on windows. It is also possible to do it manually when using the zipped binary release archive, on installation, just run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 F3DShellExtension.dll ``` To remove the shell extension, run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` ## MacOS There is no support for thumbnails on MacOS, the .dmg binary release provides automatic file openings.

    "content": "# Interactions ## Mouse Interactions Simple interaction with the displayed data is possible directly within the window. It is as follows: * *Click and drag* with the *left* mouse button to rotate around the focal point of the camera. * Hold *Shift* then *Click and drag* horizontally with the *right* mouse button to rotate the HDRI. * *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button to zoom in/out. * *Move the mouse wheel* to zoom in/out. * *Click and drag* with the *middle* mouse button to translate the camera. * *Click* with the *middle* mouse button to center the camera on the point under the cursor (hold *Shift* to allow forward or backward movement). * Drag and drop a file or directory into the F3D window to load it > Note: When playing an animation with a scene camera, camera interactions are locked. ## Hotkeys The coloring can be controlled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * `C`: cycle between coloring with array from point data and from cell data. * `S`: cycle the array to color with. * `Y`: cycle the component of the array to color with. See the [coloring cycle](#cycling-coloring) section for more info. Other options can be toggled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * `B`: display of the scalar bar, only when coloring and not using direct scalars. * `V`: volume rendering. * `I`: opacity function inversion during volume rendering. * `O`: point sprites rendering. * `P`: depth peeling. * `Q`: Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion. * `A`: Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing. * `T`: tone mapping. * `E`: the display of cell edges. * `X`: the trihedral axes display. * `G`: the XZ grid display. * `N`: the display of the file name. * `M`: the display of the metadata if exists. * `Z`: the display of the FPS counter. * `R`: raytracing. * `D`: the denoiser when raytracing. * `U`: background blur when using a HDRi. * `K`: trackball interaction mode. Note that some hotkeys can be available or not depending on the file being loaded and the F3D configuration. Other hotkeys are available: * `H`: key to toggle the display of a cheat sheet showing all these hotkeys and their statuses. * `?`: key to print scene description to the terminal. * `ESC`: close the window and quit F3D. * `ENTER`: reset the camera to its initial parameters. * `SPACE`: play the animation if any. * `LEFT`: load the previous file if any. * `RIGHT`: load the next file if any. * `UP`: reload the current file. When loading another file or reloading, options that have been changed interactively are kept but can be overridden if a dedicated regular expression block in the configuration file is present, see the [configuration file](/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html) documentation for more info. ## Cycling Coloring When using the default scene, the following hotkeys let you cycle the coloring of the data: * `C`: cycle between point data and cell data - field data is not supported. * `S`: cycle the array available on the currently selected data, skipping array not containing numeric data. It will loop back to not coloring unless using volume rendering. * `Y`: cycle the component available on the currently selected array, looping to -2 for direct scalars rendering if the array contains 4 or less components, -1 otherwise. When changing the array, the component in use will be kept if valid with the new array, if not it will be reset to 0 when coloring with an invalid higher than zero component, and to -1 when using direct scalars rendering with an array having more than 4 components. When changing the type of data to color with, the index of the array within the data will be kept if valid with the new data. If not, it will cycle until a valid array is found. After that, the component will be checked as specified above. ",

    "doc": "Limitations and Troubleshooting",
    "title": "Limitations and Troubleshooting",
    "content": "# Limitations Here is a non exhaustive list of F3D limitations: * No support for specifying manual lighting in the default scene. * Multiblock (.vtm, .gml) support is partial, non-surfacic data will be converted into surfaces. * Animation support with full scene data format require VTK >= 9.0.20201016. * Full drag and drop support require VTK >= 9.0.20210620 * Drag and drop interaction cannot be recorded nor played back. * Volume rendering and HDRI support requires a decent GPU. ## Assimp FBX, DAE, OFF, and DXF file formats rely on [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library. It comes with some known limitations: - PBR materials are not supported for FBX file format. - Animations are not working very well with Assimp 5.1, it's recommended to use Assimp 5.0. - Some files can be empty, crash, or show artifacts. - DXF support is very limited: only files with polylines and 3D faces are displayed. ## Alembic ABC file formats rely on [Alembic](https://github.com/alembic/alembic) library. It comes with some known limitations: - Supports only simple polygonal geometry. - Does not support ArbGeomParam feature in Alembic. - Does not support Subdivision Meshes. - Does not support Materials. # Troubleshooting ## General > I have built F3D with raytracing support but the denoiser is not working. Make sure that VTK has been built with *OpenImageDenoise* support (`VTKOSPRAY_ENABLE_DENOISER` option). ## Linux > I have a link error related to `stdc++fs` not found. With some C++ STD library version, explicit linking to `stdc++fs` is not supported. We provide a CMake option `F3D_LINUX_APPLICATION_LINK_FILESYSTEM` that you can set to `OFF` to workaround this issue. ### Thumbnails > Thumbnails are not working in my file manager. * Check that your file manager supports the thumbnailer mechanism. * Check that you have updated your mime type database. * If all fails, remove your `.cache` user dir and check that `pcmanfm` thumbnails are working. * If they are working, then it is an issue specific to your file manager (see below for a potential work around). * If only a few format have working thumbnails, then it is an issue with the mime types database. * If no formats have working thumbnails, then it is an issue with the `f3d.thumbnailer` file. * If only big file do not have thumbnails, this is intended, you can modify this behavior in the `thumbnail.json` configuration file using the `max-size` option. ### Sandboxing Some file managers (eg: Nautilus) are using sandboxing for thumbnails, which the F3D binary release does not support as it needs access to the Xorg server for rendering anything. A work around to this issue is to use a virtual Xorg server like Xephyr or Xvfb in the `f3d.thumbnailer` file. Here is how your `Exec` line should look to use `xvfb-run`. Keep in mind running xvfb can be very slow. `Exec=xvfb-run f3d --dry-run -sta --no-background --output=%o --resolution=%s,%s %i` Another workaround is to build VTK with EGL or osmesa support and then build F3D yourself against this custom VTK build. ## Windows > After installing F3D or registering the shell extension, my explorer is broken. Unregister the shell extension by running: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` > I use F3D in a VM, the application fails to launch. OpenGL applications like F3D can have issues when launched from Windows Server or from a guest Windows because the access to the GPU is restricted. You can try to use a software implementation of OpenGL, called [Mesa](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases). * Download the latest `release-msvc`. * copy `x64/opengl32.dll`, `libgallium_wgl.dll` and `x64/libglapi.dll` in the same folder as `f3d.exe`. * set the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to 4.5. * run `f3d.exe`. > I run f3d from the command prompt and my Unicode characters are not displayed properly. Set the codepage to UTF-8, run `chcp 65001`. ",

By default, all this information will be loaded from the file and displayed. Use the `--geometry-only` [options](/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) to modify this behavior. For file formats that do not support it, **a default scene** is created. ## Plugins If you installed F3D using a package manager, it's possible that the packager chose to bundle the plugins in different packages or to list plugin dependencies as optional dependencies to reduce the reduce the number of dependencies of the main package. In this case, in order to open a file that requires a plugin, you will have to make sure all needed dependencies are installed and specify which plugin you want to load in order to be able to open this file. You can either use the `--load-plugins` option or add a line in the [configuration file](/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html), if not already. Here is the list of plugins provided officially by F3D: - **alembic**: ABC support - **assimp**: FBX, DAE, OFF and DXF support - **draco**: DRC support - **exodus**: EX2 support - **occt**: STEP and IGES support > Note: If you downloaded the binaries from the Release page, it's not necessary to specify manually the plugins above, all of them are loaded automatically. You can also try plugins maintained by the community. If you have created a plugin and would like it to be listed here, please submit a pull request. - **Abaqus**: ODB support by @YangShen398 ([repository](https://github.com/YangShen398/F3D-ODB-Reader-Plugin)) ",
