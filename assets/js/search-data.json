    "content": "# How to contribute F3D welcomes all contributors, regardless of skill level or experience! ## Contributing as a user Contributing to F3D can be as simple as pointing out a spelling mistake on the website, reporting a bug you encountered, or suggesting a new feature you feel would improve the application. We use [Github](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d) to manage the project and you can report new issues or weigh in on existing ones [over there](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues). Also, do not hesitate to join our [discord](https://discord.f3d.app)! ## How to get started with development To contribute to F3D as a developer, first you may want to try and build F3D for yourself. If you are already familiar with software compilation, you can take a look at our [build](/doc/dev/BUILD.html) guide. If not, you may want to look at our [getting started](/doc/dev/GETTING_STARTED.html) guide, that provide steps to compile F3D. Once you are able to build F3D, you may want to take a look at the opened [issues](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues), especially, the ones with the [\"good first issue\"](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. If one sounds interesting to you, then you should just go ahead and comment on the issue and ask for any help or clarification needed. F3D maintainers will see your comment and provide guidance as needed. You can also reach out on discord. You can then fix the issue in your side and contribute it to the F3D repository, by following the workflow described below. Of course, if you are already using F3D and want to improve it for your specific needs, because you want a feature or found a bug, that is definitely possible. Feel free to reach out for guidance by opening an issue or asking on discord. Another way to get started is to improve the documentation. ## F3D Development workflow F3D uses the [gitlab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html). In a few words, here is how to contribute: - [Fork](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/fork) F3D repository on github. - Create and push a feature branch on your fork containing new commits. - When it is ready for review or when you want to run the CI, create a pull request against `f3d-app/f3d/master`. - Once the PR is approved and CI comes back clean, a F3D maintainer will merge your pull request in the master branch - The master now contains your changes and will be present in the next release! ## Continuous Integration F3D has a pretty extensive continuous integration trying to cover all usecases for F3D. It means that if your change break the CI in your PR, it will not be merged until the breaking change are addressed. It also means that adding a new feature or behavior means adding a associated test. Make sure to check the results for yourself, and ask for help if needed. F3D continuous integration will also check the coverage as it is a good way to evaluate if new features are being tested or not. When adding code to F3D, always try to cover it by adding/modifying [tests](/doc/dev/TESTING.html). F3D continuous integration also check formatting using clang-format and will inform you if changes needs to be made. However, some [formatting rules](/doc/dev/CODING_STYLE.html) are not enforced by clang-format and will be checked during the review process. When making changes to the libf3d public API, the CI will warn about making related changes to the bindings. This is required in order to merge the PR. ## Changelog Whenever you make significant changes, either bugfixes or features, please update the [changelog](/doc/CHANGELOG.html) \"Ongoing development\" section. There are three subsections. \"For F3D Users\" are changes that impact actual F3D users and related to F3D behaviors changing. \"For developers\" are change that impact developers that build F3D. \"For F3D packagers\" are for changes that impact anyone packaging F3D, eg: new CMake options. ## F3D architecture F3D is separated in different components: - The F3D application, in the application folder. - The libf3d, in the library folder. - The VTKExtensions in the library/VTKExtensions folder. - The bindings, python, java and webassembly, in the respective directories. - The plugins, providing all the different readers in the plugins directory. VTKExtensions are separated in different modules. - Core, that do not depend on any other VTKExtensions modules are provide services for all modules - Readers, that depends on Core and implements many new VTK readers and importers - Rendering, that depends on Core and implements the rendering specificities of F3D - Applicative, the depends on all other VTKExtension modules and provide services for the libf3d library The libf3d implements the whole logic of instancing and manipulating the different VTK classes, it is fully documented [here](/doc/libf3d/README_LIBF3D.html). The F3D application itself uses the libf3d but adds an applicative layer on top of it, especially the handling of [command line options](/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) and [configuration file](/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html).

F3D (pronounced `/fɛd/`) is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer. It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing. It is fully controllable from the command line and support configuration files. It can provide thumbnails, support interactive hotkeys, drag&drop and integration into file managers. F3D also contains the libf3d, a simple library to render meshes, with C++ and Python Bindings, as well as experimental Java and Javascript bindings. *A typical render by F3D* *Animation of a glTF file within F3D* *A direct scalars render by F3D* See the [gallery](/doc/GALLERY.html) for more images, take a look at the [changelog](/doc/CHANGELOG.html) or go to the [releases page](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/releases) to download F3D!

    "content": "# Build guide F3D uses a CMake based build system, so building F3D just requires installing needed dependencies, configuring and building. If you are not used to such processes please take a look at our [getting started guide](/doc/dev/GETTING_STARTED.html). ## Dependencies * [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.1. * [VTK](https://vtk.org) >= 9.0.0 (9.2.6 recommended). * A C++17 compiler. * A CMake-compatible build system (Visual Studio, XCode, Ninja, Make, etc.). * Optionally, [Assimp](https://www.assimp.org/) >= 5.0. * Optionally, Open CASCADE [OCCT](https://dev.opencascade.org/) >= 7.5.2. * Optionally, [Alembic](http://www.alembic.io/) >= 1.7. * Optionally, [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) >= 23.05. * Optionally, [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/download/) >= 10.0.0, enable `IOOpenVDB` VTK module. * Optionally, [Draco](https://google.github.io/draco/) >= 1.5. * Optionally, [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.6 and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) >= 2.2. * Optionally, [Java](https://www.java.com) >= 18. * Optionally, [OpenEXR](https://openexr.com/en/latest/) >= 3.0. ## VTK compatibility As stated in the dependencies, F3D is compatible with VTK >= 9.0.0, however, many features are only available in certain conditions. We suggest using VTK 9.2.6 with RenderingRayTracing, RenderingExternal, IOExodus and IOOpenVDB modules enabled in order to get as many features as possible in F3D. ## Configuration and building Configure and generate the project with CMake, then build the software using your build system. Here is some CMake options of interest: * `F3D_BUILD_APPLICATION`: Build the F3D executable. * `BUILD_TESTING`: Enable the [tests](/doc/dev/TESTING.html). * `F3D_MACOS_BUNDLE`: On macOS, build a `.app` bundle. * `F3D_WINDOWS_GUI`: On Windows, build a Win32 application (without console). * `F3D_WINDOWS_BUILD_SHELL_THUMBNAILS_EXTENSION`: On Windows, build the shell thumbnails extension. * `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD`: Build all plugins as static library (embedded into `libf3d`) and automatically loaded by the application. Incompatible with `F3D_MACOS_BUNDLE`. Some modules, plugins and bindings depending on external libraries can be optionally enabled with the following CMake variables: * `F3D_MODULE_RAYTRACING`: Support for raytracing rendering. Requires that VTK has been built with `OSPRay` and `VTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingRayTracing` turned on. Disabled by default. * `F3D_MODULE_EXTERNAL_RENDERING`: Support for external render window. Requires that VTK has been built with `VTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingExternal` turned on. Disabled by default. * `F3D_MODULE_EXR`: Support for OpenEXR images. Requires `OpenEXR`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_EXODUS`: Support for ExodusII (.ex2) file format. Requires that VTK has been built with `IOExodus` module (and `hdf5`). Enabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_OCCT`: Support for STEP, IGES and BREP file formats. Requires `OpenCASCADE`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ASSIMP`: Support for FBX, DAE, OFF, DXF and X file formats. Requires `Assimp`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ALEMBIC`: Support for ABC file format.

These tests are simple C++ methods that should return `EXIT_SUCESS` or `EXIT_FAILURE`. Everything is handled in `library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing`. To add a test, first identify which VTKExtensions module you need to add a test into, then create a new `TestName.cxx` file containing a `int TestName(int argc, char* argv[])` method, then implement your test in C++ using VTK and F3D VTKExtensions modules. Then add you new file to `library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing/CMakeLists.txt`. It is supported to read file as input if needed, see other tests as examples. ",

    "content": "# Classes Introduction This is only an introduction to libf3d classes. For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Engine class The engine class is the main class that needs to be instantiated. All other classes instance are provided by the engine using getters, `getLoader`, `getWindow`, `getInteractor`, `getOptions`. The engine constructor lets you choose the type of window in its constructor, `NONE`, `NATIVE`, `NATIVE_OFFSCREEN`, `EXTERNAL`. Default is `NATIVE`. See [Window class](#window-class) documentation for more info. Please note that the engine will not provide a interactor with `NONE` and `EXTERNAL`. A static function `loadPlugin` can also be called to load reader plugins. It must be called before loading any file. An internal plugin containing VTK native readers can be loaded by calling `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"native\");`. Other plugins maintained by F3D team are available if their build is enabled: `alembic`, `assimp`, `draco`, `exodus`, `occt` and `usd`. If CMake option `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD` is enabled, the plugins listed above are also static just like `native` plugin. All static plugins can be loaded using `f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins()`. ## Loader class The loader class is responsible to read and load the file from the disk. It supports reading full scene files as well as multiple geometries into a default scene. ## Window class The window class is responsible for rendering the meshes. It supports multiple modes. * `NONE`: A window that will not render anything, very practical when only trying to recover meta-information about the data. * `NATIVE`: Default mode where a window is shown onscreen using native graphical capabilities. * `NATIVE_OFFSCREEN`: Use native graphical capabilities for rendering, but unto an offscreen window, which will not appear on screen, practical when generating screenshots. * `EXTERNAL`: A window where the OpenGL context is not created but assumed to have been created externally. To be used with other frameworks like Qt or GLFW. Window lets you `render`, `renderToImage` and control other parameters of the window, like icon or windowName. ## Interactor class When provided by the engine, the interactor class lets you choose how to interact with the data. It contains the animation API to start and stop animation. Interactor also lets you set your interaction callbacks in order to modify how the interaction with the data is done. Of course, you can use `start` and `stop` to control the interactor behavior. ## Camera class Provided by the window, this class lets you control the camera. You can either specify the camera position, target, and up direction directly, or specify movements relative to the current camera state. ## Image class A generic image class that can either be created from a window, from an image filepath or even from a data buffer. It supports comparison making it very practical in testing context. ## Log class A class to control logging in the libf3d. Simple using the different dedicated methods (`print`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and `setVerboseLevel`, you can easily control what to display. Please note that, on windows, a dedicated output window may be created. ## Options class This class lets you control the behavior of the libf3d. An option is basically a string used as a key associated with a value, see the exhaustive [list](/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html). ## Reader class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly. ## Plugin class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly.

    "content": "# libf3d - A library to render 3D meshes By Michael Migliore and Mathieu Westphal. libf3d is a BSD-licensed C++ library to open and render 3D meshes. It is of course used by F3D. libf3d API is simple and easy to learn. Python bindings are provided through pybind11. Java bindings are also available. libf3d API is still in alpha version and may change drastically in the future. ## Getting Started Rendering a full scene file and starting the interaction is very easy: ```cpp #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Load a scene eng.getLoader().loadScene(\"path/to/file.ext\"); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` As well as loading multiple geometries into a default scene: ```cpp #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Load multiples geometries eng.getLoader().loadGeometry(\"path/to/file.ext\").loadGeometry(\"path/to/file2.ext\"); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` It's also possible to load a geometry from memory buffers: ```cpp #include #include #include // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Create a single triangle f3d::mesh_t mesh = {}; mesh.points = { 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f }; mesh.face_sides = { 3 }; mesh.face_indices = { 0, 1, 2 }; eng.getLoader().loadGeometry(mesh); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Manipulating the window directly can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(f3d::window::Type::NATIVE_OFFSCREEN); // Load a geometry eng.getLoader().loadGeometry(\"path/to/file.ext\"); // Set the window size and render to an image f3d::image img = eng.getWindow().setSize(300, 300).renderToImage(); // Save the image to a file img.save(\"/path/to/img.png\"); ``` Changing some options can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Recover the options and set the wanted value eng.getOptions() .set(\"render.effect.ambient-occlusion\", true) .set(\"render.effect.anti-aliasing\", true); // Standard libf3d usage eng.getLoader().loadGeometry(\"path/to/file.ext\"); eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Most options are dynamic, some are only taken into account when loading a file. See the [options](/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html) documentation. Find more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples), you can also find other usages in the [testing directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/library/testing). For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Building against the libf3d Please follow instructions in the [F3D build guide](/doc/dev/BUILD.html), then use CMake to find the libf3d and link against it like this in your CMakeLists.txt: ```cmake find_package(f3d REQUIRED) [...] target_link_libraries(target f3d::libf3d) ``` ## Extending libf3d with plugins In order to add new supported file format to libf3d, you can create a plugin using CMake macros. Please follow instructions in the [F3D plugin SDK guide](/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html). ",

    "content": "# Plugin SDK When calling `find_package(f3d)` in CMake, a few macros are made available to you to generate a plugin which allow you to extend libf3d to support your own file format. > Please consider [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.html) your plugin in [F3D directly](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/plugins) if you think it can be useful to the community. > You can also consider contributing directly [in VTK](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Documentation/dev/git/develop.md). ## Creating a plugin You can take a look at the example in the [examples/plugin](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples/plugins) directory or at the official [plugins](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/plugins). The first thing (and most difficult part) you have to do is creating a VTK reader (or a VTK importer if you want to support a full scene with materials, lights and cameras), and wrap it into a VTK module. You can create several readers in the same VTK module if you need to support several file formats in a single plugin. Then, declare the reader(s) and the plugin using the CMake macros: ```cmake f3d_plugin_init() f3d_plugin_declare_reader( NAME \"ReaderName\" EXTENSIONS \"myext\" # set the extensions the reader can support MIMETYPES \"application/vnd.myext\" # set the mimetypes the reader can support VTK_READER ${vtk_classname} # set the name of the VTK class you have created DESCRIPTION \"Reader description\" # set the description of the reader EXCLUDE_FROM_THUMBNAILER # add this flag if you don't want thumbnail generation for this reader ) # More f3d_plugin_declare_reader calls are possible f3d_plugin_build( NAME \"PluginName\" VERSION 1.0 DESCRIPTION \"Plugin description\" VTK_MODULES CommonCore CommonExecutionModel # Add more VTK modules if necessary ) ``` If the build succeeds, a library called `libf3d-plugin-.so` will be created (`f3d-plugin-.dll` on Windows) A JSON file of the following form will also be generated. It's used by F3D internally to get information about supported file formats. ```json { \"description\" : \"Plugin description\", \"name\" : \"PluginName\", \"readers\" : [ { \"description\" : \"Reader description\", \"extensions\" : [ \"myext\" ], \"mimetypes\" : [ \"application/vnd.myext\" ], \"name\" : \"ReaderName\" } ], \"type\" : \"MODULE\", \"version\" : \"1.0\" } ``` The list of existing mimetypes can be find [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). If your file format is not listed, the mimetype should be `application/vnd.${extension}` ## Loading your plugin The plugin can be loaded using `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"path or name\")` api if you are using libf3d, or `--load-plugins=\"path or name\"` option if you are using F3D application. The option can also be set in a configuration file that you could distribute with your plugin. ",

    "content": "# Configuration File Almost all the command-line options can be controlled using configuration files. Configuration files uses the \"long\" version of the command-line options in a JSON formatted file to provide values for these options. These options can be organized by block using a regular expression for each block in order to provide different default values for the different filetypes. A special block, named `global`, will apply to all files. Using a command-line option will override the corresponding value in the config file. The `global` block and command-line options are only taken into account on the first load and not on subsequent loads, when switching between files. The regular expression blocks are always taken into account, even when loading further files. Please note the regular expressions are not case-sensitive. A typical config file may look like this: ```javascript { \"global\": { \"bg-color\": \"0.7,0.7,0.7\", \"color\": \"0.5,0.1,0.1\", \"anti-aliasing\": true, \"timer\": true, \"progress\": true, \"axis\": true, \"bar\": true, \"roughness\": 0.2, \"grid\": true, \"scalars\": true }, \".*vt.\": { \"edges\": true }, \".*gl(tf|b)\": { \"raytracing\": true, \"denoise\": true, \"samples\": 3 }, \".*mhd\": { \"volume\": true } } ``` Here, the first block defines a basic global configuration with many desired options for all files. The second block specifies that all files ending with vt., eg: vtk, vtp, vtu, ... will be shown with edges visibility turned on. The third block specifies raytracing usage for .gltf and .glb files. The last block specifies that volume rendering should be used with .mhd files. Single .json file for configuration is supported, as well a config directory containing multiple .json config files. In the case of config directory, .json file are read in alphabetical order and an option in a block can be overridden by the same option being set in the same block in another .json file read after. F3D provides a default config directory for generic usage (`config.d`) and a thumbnail specific config directory (`thumbnail.d`). You can edit the file contained in these directory or copy then into specific locations (see below) in order to customize F3D behavior. The following command-line options cannot be set via config file: `help`, `version`, `readers-list`, `config`, `dry-run`. The following command-line options can only be set in the global block of the config file: `no-render`, `inputs`, `output`, `verbose`, `resolution`, `position` and all testing options. Boolean options that have been turned on in the configuration file can be turned off on the command line if needed, eg: `--point-sprites=false`. The configuration file or directory possible locations depends on your operating system. They are considered in the below order and only the first found will be used. * Linux: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `~/.config/f3d/config(.json,d)`, `/etc/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `/usr/share/f3d/configs/config(.json,.d)`, `[install_dir]/share/f3d/configs/config(.json,.d)` * Windows: `%APPDATA%\\f3d\\(config.json,.d)`, `[install_dir]\\share\\f3d\\configs\\(config.json,.d)` * macOS: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `~/.config/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `/usr/local/etc/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `f3d.app/Contents/Resources/configs/config(.json,.d)` The binary release will install the default config directory. On Linux, they will be installed in `[install_dir]/share/f3d/configs/`, on Windows, they will be installed in `[install_dir]\\share\\f3d\\configs\\`, on macOS, it will be installed in the bundle. Please note there is a command line option to control the configuration file to read. Using it, one can specify an absolute/relative path for the configuration path, but also only the filename or filestem (`.json` and `.d` will be added) to look for in the locations listed above, , eg: `f3d --config=custom_config` will look for `custom_config.json` and `custom_config.d` in locations listed above. Please note only one config file or directory will be found and parsed. ",

    "content": "# Desktop Integration F3D can be integrated in the desktop experience. ## Linux For Linux desktop integration, F3D rely on mime types files as defined by the [XDG standard](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html), .thumbnailer file as specified [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_manager_functionality#Thumbnail_previews) and .desktop file as specified [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries). Many file managers use this mechanism, including nautilus, thunar, pcmanfm and caja. The simplest way to obtain desktop integration on linux is to use a package for your distribution, or the .deb binary release package we provide if compatible with your distribution. In other cases, the binary release archive can be used like this: 0. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is part of your `PATH` 1. Extract F3D binary release archive in `~/.local/` 2. Update your [mime database](https://linux.die.net/man/1/update-mime-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/mime` 3. Update your [desktop database](https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/update-desktop-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/application` ```bash export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin tar -xzvf f3d-1.3.0-Linux.tar.gz -C ~/.local/ sudo update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/ sudo update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications ``` If you have any issues, refer to the [troubleshooting](/doc/user/LIMITATIONS_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING.html) part. ## Windows For Windows desktop integration, F3D rely on a registered shell extension. Using the F3D NSIS installer (.exe) is the simplest way to enable thumbnails and integrate F3D on windows. It is also possible to do it manually when using the zipped binary release archive, on installation, just run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 F3DShellExtension.dll ``` To remove the shell extension, run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` ## MacOS There is no support for thumbnails on MacOS, the .dmg binary release provides automatic file openings. ## Limitations - TIFF files are excluded from the thumbnailer to avoid conflicts with other better 2D thumbnailers.

    "content": "# Interactions ## Mouse Interactions Simple interaction with the displayed data is possible directly within the window. It is as follows: * *Click and drag* with the *left* mouse button to rotate around the focal point of the camera. * Hold *Shift* then *Click and drag* horizontally with the *right* mouse button to rotate the HDRI. * *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button to zoom in/out. * *Move the mouse wheel* to zoom in/out. * *Click and drag* with the *middle* mouse button to translate the camera. * *Click* with the *middle* mouse button to center the camera on the point under the cursor (hold *Shift* to allow forward or backward movement). * Drag and drop a file, directory or HDRI into the F3D window to load it. F3D relies on the extension (`.hdr` or `.exr`) to detect if the dropped file is an HDRI. > Note: When playing an animation with a scene camera, camera interactions are locked. ## Hotkeys The coloring can be controlled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * `C`: cycle between coloring with array from point data and from cell data. * `S`: cycle the array to color with. * `Y`: cycle the component of the array to color with. See the [coloring cycle](#cycling-coloring) section for more info. Other options can be toggled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * `B`: display of the scalar bar, only when coloring and not using direct scalars. * `V`: volume rendering. * `I`: opacity function inversion during volume rendering. * `O`: point sprites rendering. * `P`: translucency support. * `Q`: ambient occlusion. * `A`: anti-aliasing. * `T`: tone mapping. * `E`: the display of cell edges. * `X`: the trihedral axes display. * `G`: the horizontal grid display. * `N`: the display of the file name. * `M`: the display of the metadata if exists. * `Z`: the display of the FPS counter. * `R`: raytracing. * `D`: the denoiser when raytracing. * `U`: background blur, useful with an HDRI skybox. * `K`: trackball interaction mode. * `F`: HDRI ambient lighting. * `J`: the display of the HDRI skybox. * `L`: increase (+Shift: decrease) lights intensity. Note that some hotkeys can be available or not depending on the file being loaded and the F3D configuration. Camera Hotkeys: * `1`: front view camera. * `3`: right view camera. * `7`: top view camera. * `9`: isometric view camera. * `ENTER`: reset the camera to its initial parameters. Other hotkeys are available: * `H`: key to toggle the display of a cheat sheet showing all these hotkeys and their statuses. * `?`: key to print scene description to the terminal. * `ESC`: close the window and quit F3D. * `SPACE`: play the animation if any. * `LEFT`: load the previous file if any. * `RIGHT`: load the next file if any. * `UP`: reload the current file without resetting the camera. * `DOWN`: add current file parent directory to the list of files, reload the current file and reset the camera. When loading another file or reloading, options that have been changed interactively are kept but can be overridden if a dedicated regular expression block in the configuration file is present, see the [configuration file](/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html) documentation for more info. ## Cycling Coloring When using the default scene, the following hotkeys let you cycle the coloring of the data: * `C`: cycle between point data and cell data - field data is not supported. * `S`: cycle the array available on the currently selected data in alphabetical order, skipping array not containing numeric data. It will loop back to not coloring unless using volume rendering. * `Y`: cycle the component available on the currently selected array, looping to -2 for direct scalars rendering. When changing the array, the component in use will be kept if valid with the new array, if not it will be cycled until a valid component is found. When changing the type of data to color with, the index of the array within the data will be kept if valid with the new data. If not, it will cycle until a valid array is found. After that, the component will be checked as specified above. ",

It comes with some known limitations: - PBR materials are not supported for FBX file format. - Complex animations are not working very well with Assimp 5.1, it's recommended to use Assimp 5.0 for this use case. - Only one animation can be shown at a time, showing all animations is not supported yet. - Some files can be empty, crash, or show artifacts. - DXF support is very limited: only files with polylines and 3D faces are displayed. ## Alembic ABC file formats rely on [Alembic](https://github.com/alembic/alembic) library. It comes with some known limitations: - Supports only simple polygonal geometry. - Does not support ArbGeomParam feature in Alembic. - Does not support Subdivision Meshes. - Does not support Materials. - Does not support Animations. ## USD USD file formats rely on [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) library. It comes with some known limitations: - Skinning is slow and baked on the CPU. - Does not support Face-varying attributes. - The `usd` plugin is not shipped in the python wheels yet. ## VDB VDB file formats rely on [OpenVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb) and VTK libraries. It currently comes with some known limitations: - VDB Grid files are opened with a hard-coded 0.1 sampling rate. - The `vdb` plugin is not shipped in the python wheels yet. # Troubleshooting ## General > I have built F3D with raytracing support but the denoiser is not working. Make sure that VTK has been built with *OpenImageDenoise* support (`VTKOSPRAY_ENABLE_DENOISER` option). > My model shows up all wrong, with inverted surfaces everywhere. Your data probably contains some translucent data for some reason, turn on translucency support by pressing `P` or using the `-p` command line option. ## Linux > I have a link error related to `stdc++fs` not found. With some C++ STD library version, explicit linking to `stdc++fs` is not supported. We provide a CMake option `F3D_LINUX_APPLICATION_LINK_FILESYSTEM` that you can set to `OFF` to workaround this issue. > Thumbnails are not working in my file manager. * Check that your file manager supports the thumbnailer mechanism. * Check that you have updated your mime type database. * If all fails, remove your `.cache` user dir and check that `pcmanfm` thumbnails are working. * If they are working, then it is an issue specific to your file manager (see below for a potential work around). * If only a few format have working thumbnails, then it is an issue with the mime types database. * If no formats have working thumbnails, then it is an issue with the `f3d-plugin-xxx.thumbnailer` files. * If only big file do not have thumbnails, this is intended, you can modify this behavior in the `thumbnail.d/10_global.json` configuration folder using the `max-size` option. Some file managers (eg: Nautilus) are using sandboxing for thumbnails, which the F3D standard binary release does not support as it needs access to the Xorg server to render anything. In that case, you want to use the headless version of F3D that rely on EGL instead of Xorg, available in the [releases page](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/releases). If you use the portable archive, make sure to extract it somewhere the sandboxing system has access to, eg: Nautilus uses `bwrap` and gives it access to `/usr` but not to `/opt`. ## Windows > Using the portable binary release, I'm unable to run F3D because Windows warns about a security risk F3D is not signed by Microsoft yet so Windows shows this warning. Just click on the \"more\" button to be able to run F3D. > After installing F3D or registering the shell extension, my explorer is broken. Unregister the shell extension by running: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` > I use F3D in a VM, the application fails to launch. OpenGL applications like F3D can have issues when launched from Windows Server or from a guest Windows because the access to the GPU is restricted. You can try to use a software implementation of OpenGL, called [Mesa](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases). * Download the latest `release-msvc`. * copy `x64/opengl32.dll`, `libgallium_wgl.dll` and `x64/libglapi.dll` in the same folder as `f3d.exe`. * set the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to 4.5. * run `f3d.exe`. > I run f3d from the command prompt and my Unicode characters are not displayed properly. Set the codepage to UTF-8, run `chcp 65001`. > When I install F3D, I can't add F3D to the path and the installer complains that: `PATH too long installer unable to modify PATH!`. There are too many entry in your PATH environment variable, remove the ones you do not use. > When I try to update F3D, the installer fails with: `Error opening file for writing: F3DShellExtension.dll` Your previous F3D installation is current being used to generate thumbnails, wait for a bit or reboot your computer before updating again. ## macOS > I'm unable to use the binary release, macOS complains the file is invalid or corrupted Our macOS binary package are not signed, to work around this, you can simply run the following command: ``` xattr -cr /Applications/F3D.app ``` Then F3D should work as expected. > Using the silicon binary release, I cannot find the raytracing feature or open exodus files F3D raytracing and exodus plugin are not working on macOS silicon yet, see this [issue](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues/976). > I'm unable to get coloring right with step files F3D on macOS does not support coloring on cells because of a [VTK issue](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/issues/18969). ## Python > I can't find `usd` and `vdb` plugins after installing f3d with pip The `usd` and `vdb` plugins are not shipped in the python wheels for now, you can compile F3D yourself with them though. > Raytracing does not work after installing f3d with pip F3D raytracing feature is not shipped in the python wheels for now, you can compile F3D yourself with it though.

    "content": "# Usage Once F3D has been [installed](/doc/user/INSTALLATION.html), you should be able to open any [supported file](#supported-file-formats), by either: * Using F3D automatically, from your file manager, by directly opening a file. * Running F3D and then dragging and dropping files into it to open them. * By running F3D from the terminal with a set of command-line [options](/doc/user/OPTIONS.html). * As a [thumbnailer](/doc/user/DESKTOP_INTEGRATION.html) for all supported file formats with certain file managers. ## Supported file formats Here is the list of supported file formats: * **.vtk** : the legacy VTK format * **.vt[p\\|u\\|r\\|i\\|s\\|m]** : XML based VTK formats * **.ply** : Polygon File format * **.stl** : Standard Triangle Language format * **.dcm** : DICOM file format * **.nrrd/.nhrd** : \"nearly raw raster data\" file format * **.mhd/.mha** : MetaHeader MetaIO file format * **.tif/.tiff** : TIFF 2D/3D file format * **.ex2/.e/.exo/.g** : Exodus 2 file format * **.gml** : CityGML file format * **.pts** : Point Cloud file format * **.step/.stp** : CAD STEP exchange ISO format * **.iges/.igs** : CAD Initial Graphics Exchange Specification format * **.brep** : Open CASCADE BRep format * **.abc** : Alembic format * **.vdb** : VDB format (experimental) * **.obj** : Wavefront OBJ file format (full scene and default scene) * **.gltf/.glb** : GL Transmission Format (full scene and default scene) * **.3ds** : Autodesk 3D Studio file format (full scene) * **.wrl** : VRML file format (full scene) * **.fbx** : Autodesk Filmbox (full scene) * **.dae** : COLLADA (full scene) * **.off** : Object File Format (full scene) * **.dxf** : Drawing Exchange Format (full scene) * **.x** : DirectX Format (full scene) ## Scene construction The **full scene** formats (.gltf/.glb, .3ds, .wrl, .obj, .fbx, .dae, .off) contain not only *geometry*, but also some scene information like *lights*, *cameras*, *actors* in the scene, as well as *texture* properties. By default, all this information will be loaded from the file and displayed. Use the `--geometry-only` [options](/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) to modify this behavior. For file formats that do not support it, **a default scene** is created. ## Animations F3D can play animations for a number of file formats (.ex2/.e/.exo/.g, .gltf/.glb, .fbx, .dae, .x) if the file contains an animation. It is possible to select the animation to play using `--animation-index`, or to play all animations at once using `--animation-index=-1` (.gltf/.glb only). When F3D play an animation, it assumes the time unit is in seconds to show accurate speed of animation. Use `--animation-speed-factor` if an adjustment is needed. By default, F3D will try update the scene 60 times per seconds, use `--animation-frame-rate` to change that if needed. ## Plugins If you installed F3D using a package manager, it's possible that the packager chose to bundle the plugins in different packages or to list plugin dependencies as optional dependencies to reduce the reduce the number of dependencies of the main package. In this case, in order to open a file that requires a plugin, you will have to make sure all needed dependencies are installed and specify which plugin you want to load in order to be able to open this file. You can either use the `--load-plugins` option or add a line in the [configuration file](/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html), if not already. Several plugins can be specified by giving a comma-separated list. Here is the list of plugins provided officially by F3D: - **alembic**: ABC support - **assimp**: FBX, DAE, OFF, DXF and X support - **draco**: DRC support - **exodus**: EX2 support - **occt**: STEP and IGES support - **usd**: USD, USDA, UDSC and USDZ support - **vdb**: VDB support (experimental) > Note: If you downloaded the binaries from the Release page, it's not necessary to specify manually the plugins above, all of them are loaded automatically. Here is how the plugins are searched (by precedence order): 1. Search the static plugins 2. Consider the option given is a full path 3. Search in the paths specified in `F3D_PLUGINS_PATH` environment variable 4. Search in a directory relative to the F3D application: `../lib` 5. Rely on OS specific paths (e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS) You can also try plugins maintained by the community. If you have created a plugin and would like it to be listed here, please submit a pull request. - **Abaqus**: ODB support by @YangShen398 ([repository](https://github.com/YangShen398/F3D-ODB-Reader-Plugin)) ",
